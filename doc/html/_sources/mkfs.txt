File System Creation
====================

A S3QL file system is created with the `mkfs.s3ql` command. It has the following syntax::

  mkfs.s3ql [options] <storage url>

If you want to overwrite an existing bucket, you have to delete the
bucket with `tune.s3ql --delete` first.

You can specify the following options:

  --s3-location=S3_LOCATION
                        Specify storage location for new bucket. Allowed
                        values: EU,us-west-1, or us-standard. The later is not
                        recommended, please refer to the FAQ for more
                        information.
  --homedir=HOMEDIR     Directory for log files, cache and authentication
                        info.Default: ~/.s3ql
  -L LABEL              Filesystem label
  --blocksize=BLOCKSIZE
                        Maximum size of s3 objects in KB (default: 10240)
  --encrypt             Create an encrypted and compressed file system
  --debug=DEBUG         Activate debugging output from specified module. Use
                        'all' to get debug messages from all modules. This
                        option can be specified multiple times.
