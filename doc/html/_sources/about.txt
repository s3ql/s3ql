 About S3QL
============

S3QL is a file system that can store all its data in an online storage
service (like `Amazon S3 <http://aws.amazon.com/s3 Amazon S3>`_,
`Strato HiDrive <http://www.strato.de/hidrive>`_, or any FTP server).
It effectively provides you with harddisk of infinite capacity that
can be accessed from any computer with internet access.

S3QL has been designed mainly for backup and archival purposes and
many of its features are especially geared towards this. However,
since S3QL is providing a standard UNIX file system, it can in
principle be used for any other application as well.

S3QL is designed to favor simplicity and elegance over performance and
feature-richness. Care has been taken to make the source code as
readable and serviceable as possible. Solid error detection and error
handling have been included from the very first line, and S3QL comes
with extensive automated test cases for all its components.

Features
========


* **Transparency.** Generally, you will not be able to distinguish S3QL
  from a local file system like ext3 or NTFS. S3QL removes any limits
  of the underlying storage system (e.g. the 5 GB file size limit of
  Amazon S3 or the inability to make hard links over FTP).

* **Compression.** Before storage, all data can be compressed with the
  LZMA algorithm (which is roughly 15% more efficient than the ``bzip2
  -9`` command on Unix).

* **Encryption.** After compression (but still before storage), all
  data can be AES encrypted with a 256 bit key. An additional SHA256
  HMAC checksum is used to protect the data against manipulation.

* **Data De-duplication.** If several files have identical contents,
  the redundant data will be stored only once. This works across all
  files stored in the file system, and also if only some parts of the
  files are identical while other parts differ.

* **Writable Snapshots.** Inside an S3QL file system, you can duplicate
  entire directory trees without using any additional storage space.
  Only if one of the copies is modified, the part of the data that
  has been modified will take up additional storage space (*Copy on
  Write*).

  This feature can be used to create *snapshots* of the contents of a
  given directory at a given point in time.

* **Support for high latency, low bandwidth connections.** S3QL saves
  the file and directory structure in a database that is downloaded
  once when the file system is mounted and uploaded again when the
  file system is unmounted. *All operations that do not directly
  write or read file contents can therefore be carried out very fast
  without any network transactions*. (Such operations are directory
  creation, moving and renaming files, changing permissions, etc).

  File contents are cached, so reading or writing to a file requires
  network access only if the data is not yet in the cache. Each file
  is also split into small blocks that are stored separately, and if
  data is needs to be transferred over the network, only the required
  block is written or retrieved. Therefore *making a small change (or
  reading a small part) in a large file does not require the entire
  file to be transferred*.
