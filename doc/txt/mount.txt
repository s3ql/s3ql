==========
 Mounting
==========


A S3QL file system is mounted with the `mount.s3ql` command. It has the following syntax::
 mount.s3ql [options] <storage url> <mountpoint>

Note that S3QL is not a network file system like `NFS
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System_%28protocol%29>`_ or
`CIFS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIFS>`_, so an S3QL file system
can only be mounted on one computer at a time.

You can specify the following options:

  --homedir=HOMEDIR     Directory for log files, cache and authentication
                        info.Default: ~/.s3ql
  --cachesize=CACHESIZE
                        Cache size in kb (default: 102400 (100 MB)). Should be
                        at least 10 times the blocksize of the filesystem,
                        otherwise an object may be retrieved and written
                        several times during a single write() or read()
                        operation.
  --debug=DEBUG         Activate debugging output from specified module. Use
                        'all' to get debug messages from all modules. This
                        option can be specified multiple times.
  --quiet               Be really quiet
  --allow-other         Allow other users to access the filesystem as well and
                        enforce unix permissions. (if neither this option nor
                        --allow_other is specified, only the mounting user can
                        access the file system, and has full access to every
                        file, independent of individual permissions.
  --allow-root          Allow root to access the filesystem as well and
                        enforce unix permissions. (if neither this option nor
                        --allow_other is specified, only the mounting user can
                        access the file system, and has full access to every
                        file, independent of individual permissions.
  --fg                  Do not daemonize, stay in foreground
  --single              Run in single threaded mode. If you don't understand
                        this, then you don't need it.
  --atime               Update directory access time. Will decrease
                        performance.
  --profile             Create profiling information. If you don't understand
                        this, then you don't need it.
