==============
 Installation
==============

S3QL depends on several other programs and libraries that have to be
installed first. The best method to satisfy these dependencies depends
on your distribution.

Ubuntu/Debian
=============

Installation under Ubuntu/Debian is very simple since S3QL and all
its dependencies are available as pre-build packages. To install them,
first register the package repository by executing ::

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nikratio/s3ql

then update the list of available packages with `aptitude update` and
install s3ql with `aptitude install s3ql`. If you are running Ubuntu
Karmic, you will get a warning that the `fuse-utils` package needs to
be upgraded as well, which you can safely confirm.



Fedora
======

Starting with Fedora 12, most of S3QL's dependencies are
already available as packages and can be installed with following
command (if you want, you can remove packages ending
in `-devel` again when the installation is complete)::

  sudo yum install python-devel libattr-devel fuse-devel cmake \
              pycryptopp python-paramiko xz-devel

In addition to that, the GCC-XML compiler needs to be compiled from
source as follows:

#. Retrieve the sources from the CVS tree with the command ::

     cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@www.gccxml.org:/cvsroot/GCC_XML login

   (just press enter when asked for a password) followed by ::

     cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@www.gccxml.org:/cvsroot/GCC_XML co gccxml

   This will create a new directory called `gccxml` in the current directory.

#. Change into the new `gccxml` directory and create a new
   sub-directory `gccxml-build` ::

     cd gccxml
     mkdir gccxml-build

#. Change into the build directory and build and install gccxml with the commands ::

     cd gccxml-build
     cmake ..
     make
     sudo make install

After that, you also have to install the `Python APSW module
<http://code.google.com/p/apsw/>`_:

#. Download the source from http://code.google.com/p/apsw/downloads/list
#. Extract the zip file and change into the new directory
#. Run `python setup.py fetch --sqlite build install --user` to
   install the module into `~/.local` or run `sudo python setup.py fetch
   --sqlite build install` to install system-wide.

   You will get a lot of compiler warnings add this step, but this is
   expected and no cause for concern.

Finally, S3QL also requires the `PyLibLZMA
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyliblzma>`_ and `unittest2
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2>`_ Python modules. However,
these modules will be downloaded and installed automatically during
the S3QL installation if necessary (the PyLibLZMA module needs to
be version 0.5.3 or newer).

Once all the dependencies have been satisfied as described, you can
continue with :ref:`inst-s3ql`.

CentOs
======

Under CentOS 5, you can install most of S3QL's dependencies with the
following commands, to be run as root: (thanks to `heri16
<http://code.google.com/u/heri16/>`_)::

  yum install libattr-devel fuse-libs fuse-devel fuse gcc-c++ bzip2 unzip

  wget http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-3.noarch.rpm
  yum --nogpgcheck localinstall epel-release-5-3.noarch.rpm

  yum --enablerepo=rpmforge install cmake

  cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@www.gccxml.org:/cvsroot/GCC_XML login
  # (just press enter when prompted for a password)
  cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@www.gccxml.org:/cvsroot/GCC_XML co gccxml
  mkdir gccxml-build
  cd gccxml-build
  cmake ../gccxml
  make
  make test
  make install
  cd ..

  wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pycryptopp/pycryptopp-0.5.17.tar.gz
  tar -xf pycryptopp-0.5.17.tar.gz
  cd pycryptopp*
  python26 setup.py build
  python26 setup.py test
  python26 setup.py install
  cd ..

CentOS specific installation instructions for the `Python APSW module
<http://code.google.com/p/apsw/>`_, the `Paramiko Python Module
<http://www.lag.net/paramiko/>`_ and the `XZ Utils
<http://tukaani.org/xz/>`_ are not yet available. Please refer to the
instructions for other distributions and post your results to the
mailing list, so that this documentation can be extended.

Once all the dependencies have been satisfied as described, you can
continue with :ref:`inst-s3ql`.

Other distributions
===================

The following is a list of the programs and libraries required by
S3QL. Generally, you should first check if your distribution already
provides a suitable packages and only install from source if that is
not the case.

The programs/libraries are required to run S3QL:

* Kernel version 2.6.26 or newer.

* The **Python development headers** should be available as a
  package in your distribution. The package is typically called
  something like `python-dev`, `python-devel` or `python2.6-devel`.
  To check if this package is installed, try to execute
  `python-config` (it should print out a brief help message).

* The **extended attribute headers** should be available as a
  package in your distribution. The package is typically called
  something like `libattr-dev`, `libattr1-dev`, `libattr-devel` or
  `libattr1-devel`. To see if this package is installed, check for a
  file called `xattr.h` in either `/usr/include/attr/` or
  `/usr/local/include/attr/`.

* The `FUSE Library <http://fuse.sourceforge.net/>`_ should already be
  installed on your system. However, you have to make sure that you
  have at least version 2.8 and that you also have the FUSE headers
  installed (the package is typically called something like
  `fuse-dev`, `libfuse-dev`, `fuse-devel` or `libfuse-devel`).

  To test if the FUSE library is installed with development headers,
  run the command `pkg-config --modversion fuse`. It should print a
  version number.

* The `XZ Utils <http://tukaani.org/xz/>`_ (formerly known as LZMA Utils)
  are probably available as a package for your system. Make sure that
  you also install the development headers, which may be in a separate
  package. The packages are typically called something like `liblzma`
  and `liblzma-dev` or `libxz` and `libxz-dev`.

  To test if the correct package is installed, run the command
  `pkg-config --modversion liblzma`. It should print a version number.

* The `GCC-XML compiler <http://www.gccxml.org>`_ compiler may or may
  not be available as a package. To check if GCC-XML is installed, try
  to run `gccxml --version`. If you need to install GCC-XML manually,
  please refer to the instructions for installing under Fedora or the
  `GCC-XML installation instructions
  <http://www.gccxml.org/HTML/Install.html>`_.

* The `PyCrypto++ Python Module
  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycryptopp>`_ may or may not be
  available as a package. To check if this module is installed, try to
  execute `python -c 'import pycryptopp'`. To manually install
  PyCrypto++, download it from the website, extract it and run `python
  setup.py install --user`.

* The `APSW Python Module <http://code.google.com/p/apsw/>`_ may be
  available as a package, but most likely the version of the package
  will not be recent enough. To check which version of APWS is
  installed, run the command ::

    python -c 'import apsw; print apsw.apswversion(), apsw.sqlitelibversion()'

  If APSW is installed, this should print two version numbers which
  both have to be at least 3.6.19. To install APSW manually, download
  it from the website, extract it and run `python setup.py install
  --user`. You will get a lot of compiler warnings add this step, but
  this is expected and no cause for concern.

* The `PyLibLZMA Python module
  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyliblzma>`_ is probably not yet
  available as a package. It will, however, be automatically
  downloaded and installed during the S3QL installation if required.

  If you want to check if the module is installed, try to execute
  `python -c 'import lzma; print lzma.__version__'`. This should print
  a version number. You need at least version 0.5.3.

* The `unittest2 Python module <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyliblzma>`_ is
  probably not yet available as a package. It will, however, be
  automatically downloaded and installed during the S3QL installation
  if required.

  If you want to check if the module is installed, try to execute
  `python -c 'import unittest2`. The command should succeed without
  printing anything.

* If you want to use the SFTP backend, then you also need the
  `Paramiko Python Module <http://www.lag.net/paramiko/>`_. It may or
  may not be available as a package. To check if this module is
  installed, try to execute `python -c 'import paramiko'`. To manually
  install Paramiko, download it from the website, extract it and run
  `python setup.py install --user`.

Once all the dependencies have been satisfied as described, you can
continue with :ref:`inst-s3ql`.

.. _inst-s3ql:

Installing S3QL
===============

To install S3QL itself, proceed as follows:

1. Download S3QL from http://code.google.com/p/s3ql/downloads/list
2. Unpack it into a folder of your choice
3. Run `python setup.py build` to build the package
4. Run `python setup.py test` to run a self-test. If this fails, ask
   for help on the `mailing list
   <http://groups.google.com/group/s3ql>`_ or report a bug in the
   `issue tracker <http://code.google.com/p/s3ql/issues/list>`_.

Now you have three options to complete the installation:

* You can run the S3QL commands from the `bin/` directory. For that,
  you have to execute `python setup.py build_ext --inplace` first.

* You can install S3QL system-wide for all users. To do that, you
  have to run `sudo python setup.py install`.

* You can install S3QL into `~/.local` by executing `python
  setup.py install --user`. In this case you should make sure that
  `~/.local/bin` is in your `$PATH` environment variable.
