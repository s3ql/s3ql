Managing File Systems
=====================

The `s3qladm` command performs various operations on *unmounted* S3QL
file systems. The file system *must not be mounted* when using
`s3qladm` or things will go wrong badly.

The syntax is ::

 s3qladm [options] <action> <storage-url>

where :var:`action` may be either of :program:`passphrase`, :program:`restore-metadata`,
:program:`clear`, :program:`recover-key` or :program:`upgrade`.

The :program:`s3qladm` accepts the following general options, no
matter what specific action is being invoked:

.. pipeinclude:: s3qladm --help
   :start-after: show this help message and exit


Changing the Passphrase
-----------------------

To change the passphrase of a file system, use the `passphrase`
subcommand::

  s3qladm passphrase  <storage url>

This will not actually re-encrypt all the stored data with the new passphrase. Rather, S3QL
generates an internal "master key" when the file system is created and uses this key to
encrypt all stored data. The user-supplied passphrase is used to encrypt/decrypt only the
master key, and can therefore be changed. This means, however, that if a passphrase has
been disclosed to someone untrusted, changing it afterwards will **not revoke access to
people who had access to the old passphrase** (because they could have decrypted the
master key and retained a copy).

Recovering the master key
-------------------------

If you've been extremely unlucky, then it is possible that a bug in S3QL or data-loss by
your storage provider has resulted in object that holds the filesystem master key becoming
inaccessible. In this case, knowing the passphrase does not help, as there is no master
key to decrypt with it.

If you have also been diligent, then you can restore the master key from the external copy
that :program:`mkfs.s3ql` has asked you to make on filesystem creation time::

  s3qladm recover-key <storage url>



Restoring Metadata Backups
--------------------------

If the most-recent copy of the file system metadata has been damaged
irreparably, it is possible to restore one of the automatically
created backup copies.

The command ::

  s3qladm restore-metadata <storage url>

will give you a list of the available metadata backups and allow you
to select one to restore.

.. WARNING::

   You should probably not use this functionality without having asked
   for help on the mailing list first (see :ref:`resources`).


Deleting a file system
----------------------

A file system can be deleted with::

  s3qladm clear <storage url>

This physically deletes all the data and file system structures.




Upgrading the file system
-------------------------

If you have installed a new version of S3QL, it may sometimes be
necessary to upgrade the file system metadata as well. After this operation,
the file system can no longer be accessed with older
versions of S3QL.

During the upgrade you have to make sure that the command is not
interrupted, and that no one else tries to mount, check or upgrade the
file system at the same time.

To upgrade a file system from the previous to the current revision,
execute ::

  s3qladm upgrade <storage url>
