==========
Unmounting
==========

To unmount an S3QL file system, use the command::

 umount.s3ql [options] <mountpoint>

This will block until all data has been written to the backend.

Only the user who mounted the file system with :program:`mount.s3ql`
is able to unmount it again. If you are root and want to unmount an
S3QL file system mounted by an ordinary user, you have to use the
:command:`fusermount -u` or :command:`umount` command instead. Note
that these commands do not block until all data has been uploaded, so
if you use them instead of `umount.s3ql` then you should manually wait
for the `mount.s3ql` process to terminate before shutting down the
system.

The :program:`umount.s3ql` command accepts the following options:

.. pipeinclude:: umount.s3ql --help
   :start-after: show this help message and exit

If, for some reason, the `umount.s3ql` command does not work, the file
system can also be unmounted with `fusermount -u -z`. Note that this
command will return immediately and the file system may continue to
upload data in the background for a while longer.
