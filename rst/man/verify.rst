=====================
The |command| command
=====================


Synopsis
========

::

   s3ql_verify [options] <storage url>

Description
===========

.. include:: ../include/about.rst

The |command| command verifies all data in the file system.  In
contrast to :program:`fsck.s3ql`, |command| does not trust the object
listing returned by the backend, but actually attempts to retrieve
every object. It therefore takes a lot longer.

The format of :var:`<storage url>` depends on the backend that is
used. The S3QL User's Guide should be consulted for a description of
the available backends.

Options
=======

The |command| command accepts the following options.

.. pipeinclude:: s3ql_verify --help --log none
   :start-after: show this help message and exit


Exit Codes
==========

|command| may terminate with the following exit codes:
