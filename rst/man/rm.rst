=====================
The |command| command
=====================

Synopsis
========

::

   s3qlrm [options] <directory>

Description
===========

.. include:: ../include/about.rst

The |command| command recursively deletes files and directories on an S3QL file
system. Although |command| is faster than using e.g.  :command:`rm -r`, the main reason
for its existence is that it allows you to delete immutable trees (which can be created
with :program:`s3qllock`) as well.

Be warned that there is no additional confirmation. The directory will
be removed entirely and immediately.

|command| can only be called by the user that mounted the file system
and (if the file system was mounted with :cmdopt:`--allow-other` or
:cmdopt:`--allow-root`) the root user.


Options
=======

The |command| command accepts the following options:

.. pipeinclude:: s3qlrm --help
   :start-after: show this help message and exit


Exit Codes
==========

|command| may terminate with the following exit codes:

.. include:: ../include/exitcodes.rst


.. include:: ../include/postman.rst

.. |command| replace:: :program:`s3qlrm`
