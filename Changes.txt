xx, S3QL 0.10

  * fsck.s3ql is now several orders of magnitude faster.
  
  * When running cp.s3ql, the attributes of the target directory are
    now immediately refreshed (so that e.g. ls immediately shows the
    correct number of hard links).
    
    
2010-04-04, S3QL 0.9

  * The --cachedir, --logfile, --awskey and --credfile options are gone and
    have been replaced by --homedir.
    
  * ~/.awssecret is no longer read, instead there is a common file with 
    authentication data for all backends in ~/.s3ql/authinfo
    
  * The syntax for mounting S3 buckets is now s3://bucketname instead of
    just the bucket name
    
  * There is now an SFTP backend. Thanks to Ron Knapp <ron.siesta@gmail.com> for
    most of the code.
     

2010-03-07, S3QL 0.8

  * S3QL now uses Python's default unittest.py instead of shipping its own.
  
  * Most documentation has been moved from the Wiki into the tarball, so that
    it always corresponds to the correct version.
  
  * setuptools is now used for installation. This allows .egg creation, dependency
    resolution and generation of the HTML documentation.

  * The S3 part of boto has been integrated into S3QL.  
 
2010-02-22, beta7

  * mount.s3ql no longer chdirs into / when daemonizing but into the
    cache directory.
  
  * Added example backup script in contrib/backup.py
  
  * tune.s3ql --change-passphrase is working again
  
  * Added testcase for tune.s3ql --change-passphrase 
  
  * Internal S3 errors are now handled properly by retrying the upload.
 
2010-02-19, beta6

 * tune.s3ql --copy is now *really* working properly (brrr)
 
2010-02-19, beta5

 * mkfs.s3ql now makes strict checks on the bucket name
 
 * Removed obsolete mount.s3ql_local from distribution
 
 * tune.s3ql --copy is now working properly

2010-02-19, beta4

    * tune.s3ql now has a --copy option to copy buckets
    
    * Storage location for new buckets can be specified in mkfs.s3ql and 
      tune.s3ql with --s3-location
      
    * Fixed a deadlock in mount.s3ql when using local buckets without --fg
    
    * The local: bucket specifier is no longer artificially slow.

    * mount.s3ql: --allow_other is now working

2010-02-04, beta3

    * Fixed a deadlock that caused umount.s3ql to hang indefinitely when
      mount was called without --fg
      
    * The '.' and '..' directory entries are no longer explicitly stored
      in the database.
       
    * Rewrote the mechanism to handle delayed updates. Now it no longer depends
      on a small object being propagated relatively fast, but is able to handle
      arbitrary network outages.
