2010-05-28, S3QL 0.15

  * Fixed test cases to handle systems with low system clock resolution.

  * Corrected installation instructions for Debian

  * mount.s3ql: instead of --bzip2, --zlib and --no-compress, there
    is now just one option --compress=<alg>.

  * File system metadata is now uploaded in with all indices. This
    makes mounting the file system much faster. Only if LZMA
    compression has been chosen, indices are stripped for storage and
    regenerated on the next mount.

2010-05-14, S3QL 0.14

  * fsck now detects if a cached block is dirty and commits only dirty
    blocks to the backend.

  * Installation in Debian and Ubuntu is now much simpler, it can be
    done completely with aptitude.

2010-05-04, S3QL 0.13

  * S3QL now works with Ubuntu Karmic / 10.04 LTS

  * The test command no longer produces bogus error messages after
    all tests have completed.

  * The umount.s3ql command now properly handles the 'fuser' output
    with Kernel 2.6.32 (before it always refused to unmount, claiming
    that the mount point was busy).

  * The compression can now be specified independently from the encryption,
    so it is possible to have an unencrypted, but compressed file system.

  * Apart from zlib, bzip2 and lzma, data can now also be stored
    without any compression.

  * S3QL no longer emulates the . and .. directory entries since this
    is not required by POSIX and makes the code much simpler. This
    also means that the st_nlink value of a directory is not longer
    2 + number of subdirectories.

  * Fixed a bug that caused files to be listed with wrong sizes under
    certain conditions.

  * Added `expire_backups` command and instructions for a simple backup
    solution using S3QL and rsync.

2010-04-27, S3QL 0.12

  * fsck.s3ql now accepts a --batch option to not prompt for any user
    input and requires a --force option to check the file system even
    if it is marked as clean.

  * Fixed a bug in cp.s3ql that caused incorrect st_nlink values in the
    copy.

  * fsck.s3ql has been even more optimized.

  * Fixed a problem with running out of file descriptors when lots of
    objects are deleted.

  * Bucket encryption passwords can now also be stored in
    the ~/.s3ql/authinfo file.

  * mount.s3ql doesn't complain any more if it receives any of the standard
    mount(8) mount options.


2010-04-24, S3QL 0.11

  * S3QL file system can now be mounted from /etc/fstab

  * Metadata now takes significantly less space.

  * Files with extended attributes can now be deleted.

  * Extended attributes can now be listed.

  * It is now possible to choose between zlib, BZip2 and LZMA compression
    every time the file system is mounted.

  * Added contrib/benchmark.py to find out optimal compression method
    for given network bandwidth.

  * fsck.s3ql no longer uses mknod(3) , since that lead to errors on e.g.
    NFS mounted volumes under Fedora.

  * File access, modification and inode change times before 1972 are
    now supported.

  * Fixed a deadlock when removing or overwriting files.

2010-04-21, S3QL 0.10

  * S3QL now depends on FUSE version 2.8

  * Cached blocks are now flushed to the backend as soon as they have not
    been accessed for more than 10 seconds.

  * The setup script now automatically checks and, if necessary, installs
    the Python module dependencies.

  * mkfs.s3ql now creates compressed and encrypted file systems by default.

  * Data is now compressed with LZMA instead of Bzip2.

  * Data compression and data upload is now done in parallel, so the full network
    can bandwidth is continuously without breaks for data compression.

  * fsck.s3ql is now several orders of magnitude faster. The code has been
    optimized and some special database indices are now precalculated.

  * When running cp.s3ql, the attributes of the target directory are
    now immediately refreshed (so that e.g. ls immediately shows the
    correct number of hard links).

  * File removal is now significantly faster, since the network transactions
    are carried out asynchronously as part of the cache expiration.

  * mount.s3ql no longer tries to create files with mknod(), since that
    lead to errors on NFS mounted volumes under Fedora.

  * This releases includes a lot of new code, so it may be slightly
    more beta-ish than usual.


2010-04-04, S3QL 0.9

  * The --cachedir, --logfile, --awskey and --credfile options are gone and
    have been replaced by --homedir.

  * ~/.awssecret is no longer read, instead there is a common file with
    authentication data for all backends in ~/.s3ql/authinfo

  * The syntax for mounting S3 buckets is now s3://bucketname instead of
    just the bucket name

  * There is now an SFTP backend. Thanks to Ron Knapp <ron.siesta@gmail.com> for
    most of the code.


2010-03-07, S3QL 0.8

  * S3QL now uses Python's default unittest.py instead of shipping its own.

  * Most documentation has been moved from the Wiki into the tarball, so that
    it always corresponds to the correct version.

  * setuptools is now used for installation. This allows .egg creation, dependency
    resolution and generation of the HTML documentation.

  * The S3 part of boto has been integrated into S3QL.

2010-02-22, beta7

  * mount.s3ql no longer chdirs into / when daemonizing but into the
    cache directory.

  * Added example backup script in contrib/backup.py

  * tune.s3ql --change-passphrase is working again

  * Added testcase for tune.s3ql --change-passphrase

  * Internal S3 errors are now handled properly by retrying the upload.

2010-02-19, beta6

 * tune.s3ql --copy is now *really* working properly (brrr)

2010-02-19, beta5

 * mkfs.s3ql now makes strict checks on the bucket name

 * Removed obsolete mount.s3ql_local from distribution

 * tune.s3ql --copy is now working properly

2010-02-19, beta4

    * tune.s3ql now has a --copy option to copy buckets

    * Storage location for new buckets can be specified in mkfs.s3ql and
      tune.s3ql with --s3-location

    * Fixed a deadlock in mount.s3ql when using local buckets without --fg

    * The local: bucket specifier is no longer artificially slow.

    * mount.s3ql: --allow_other is now working

2010-02-04, beta3

    * Fixed a deadlock that caused umount.s3ql to hang indefinitely when
      mount was called without --fg

    * The '.' and '..' directory entries are no longer explicitly stored
      in the database.

    * Rewrote the mechanism to handle delayed updates. Now it no longer depends
      on a small object being propagated relatively fast, but is able to handle
      arbitrary network outages.
